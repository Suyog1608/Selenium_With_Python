# Selenium_With_Python
<h4>Test Automation using with Python-Selenium</h4>
<p>Good to have basic knowledge of python and html</p>

<h5>Why do we need to automate tests</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Decreased cost and time of testing</li>
  <li>Enable continuous delivery through round-the-cloack testing</li>
  <li>Ensure regression testing</li>
  <li>Increased test coverage</li>
  <li>Cross-device testing made easy</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Mike cohn's test automation pyramid</b></p>
<ul>
    <b>[ User Interface tests <-- Service/API layer tests <-- Unit test ]</b><br><br>

  <li>Unit tests which is the bottom most layer of pyramid which is most numerous and have maximum coverage, <br>
  Used to test small line of code and hence can not be used for integration testing or system testing.</li>
  <li>Service/APi layer tests functionality in terms of services, <br>
  Service means an program where application takes input to produce the outputs,<br>
  Main aim is to seperate UI testing from functionality testing, therby saving the cost and time of UI testing</li>
  <li>UI layer is used to test only the functionality of UI elements</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Python in Automated testing</b>
  <ul>
    <li>provides diff tools for Unit testing and API testing like : unittest, pytest, nose</li>
    <li>for UI level of testing mostly tools are used Selenium and Python</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Selenium Autmation Framework</b>
  <li> Selenium Automate browsers </li>
  <li> Used for web UI automation -- the automatic execution of the actions performed in a web browser window</li>
  <li> Used for robust, browser-based regression testing</li>
  <li> Used to scale tests to multiple browsers and environment using Selenium</li>
